This is the readme file for the source code of ChangHui's images
Uses OpenCV
The original images are in .nd2 format. We need to convert it to tif before we start processing.
To convert .nd2 to tif files Bio-Formats 5.2.2 (http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.2.2/) was downloaded and installed.
The Bio-format tools have been extracted into this folder.


Explanation of Images written:
Layer_n depicts the original converted tif images.
Imagename_dend (depicts detected dendrites),  
redlow, redmed, redhigh (depicts low,med, high intensity synapses, respectively),
GreenMIP,Redmip denote the original MaximalIntensityProjection (MIP) images, 
remove.png is just an image created and used for processing.

NOTE:To automate for multiple images make sure the csv file is in append mode and insert an endl to sure the metric are written correctly. A bash file was written , which automated the conversion and the analysis of the images.
Use the RUN_MULTIPLE.sh file to do both conversion and analysis.

To run the code, two command are needed:
./bfconvert -nolookup "$file" "$file".tif 
./analyze  "$file"  
where file is the name of the image
